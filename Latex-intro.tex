\section{Introduction}
The first question maybe why I should learn Latex? Let's try to answer that question first.
\begin{itemize}
\item Editor independent
\item Portable, being in ASCII
\item Excellent quality of Typesetting
\item Easiness of referencing and indexing
\item Matchless for technical documents
\item And it's \textbf{FREE}
\end{itemize}
